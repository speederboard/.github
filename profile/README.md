# speederboard

speederboard was developed after we noticed people complaining about the ads on speedrun.com. 

We haven't started a hosted instance yet. Not everything is nailed down. Come help out on [speederboard/speederboard](https://github.com/speederboard/speederboard)!
We'd love to have you.

We also have [some developer documentation](https://developer-docs.speederboard.org). Give it a read!

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
